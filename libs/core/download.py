"""Threaded helper used to download remote resources.

The original implementation mixed resource management and lacked a number of
robustness checks which could lead to crashes (for example when the
``Content-Length`` header was missing) and left HTTP sessions open.  The class
below keeps the behaviour but improves reliability and readability.
